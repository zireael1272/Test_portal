Lab4 - System analysis

Develop testing software. The system should allow the administrator to create new tests and add questions to existing tests. For each question, the administrator determines the number of answer options and correct answers, the answer options themselves, and the correct answers. In addition, the user can assign a group to each question. For each test, the administrator determines the number of questions, as well as the questions for each group. The user can take the test according to the selected test. The test is formed from the total number of available questions (for a given test), with the required number of questions for each group being selected at random. The system should provide the ability to register and authorize.
